# Ethereum-Fraud_Detection
# Introduction
Ether, the cryptocurrency of Ethereum network is a popular digital token next to Bitcoin. Ether was conceived in 2013, by Vitalik Buterin, a Russian-Canadian programmer. In 2014, it was crowdfunded and went live in July 2015. Ethereum uses blockchain technology not just for a decentralized payment system but also for storing financial information, contracts and applications, powered by its crypto, Ether. 
# Goal
With cryptocurrency being one of the most mysterious and highly lucrative money ventures, there is naturally an abundance of fraudulent activity. As a result, our teamâ€™s goal is to build a classification model that identifies whether or not an Ethereum transaction is valid or not in order to combat this fraudulent activity. With this model, we plan to protect those who trade in Ethereum (especially those who are newer to the cryptocurrency) and help reduce risk and fear surrounding cryptocurrencies.
# Dataset
The dataset has been obtained from Kaggle (see the link here: Ethereum Fraud Prediction Dataset https://www.kaggle.com/vagifa/ethereum-frauddetection-dataset).
